# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to find potential academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. I will focus on the reading and math scores of the ninth graders. I will replace the grades with NaN and redo the whole process to find any differences.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

The district summary was not changed all that much other than the three percent passing values. Even then the differences were very small and did not affect the data overall. 

These are the outputs of both district summaries:

![district_summary_2]( https://github.com/Robeliom15/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district_summary_2.png?raw=true)


- How is the school summary affected?

The situation is the same for this data since the change is very small and does not affect it overall.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School does not affect the performance of the high school and it stays the same as before.
