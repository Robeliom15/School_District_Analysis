# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to find potential academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. I will focus on the reading and math scores of the ninth graders. I will replace the grades with NaN and redo the whole process to find any differences.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

The district summary was not changed all that much other than the three percent passing values. Even then the differences were very small and did not affect the data overall. 

These are the outputs of both district summaries:

![district_summary_2]( https://github.com/Robeliom15/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/district_summary_2.png?raw=true)


- How is the school summary affected?

The situation is the same for this data since the change is very small and does not affect it overall.

These are the outputs of both school summaries:

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School does not affect the performance of the high school and it stays the same as before. 

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the Data

When looking over the data and comparing the different categories I saw that the difference was too small to make a difference. The data I focused on were math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, scores by school type. 

## Summary

The goal of this project was to check if there was any academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. When I removed the ninth-grade math and reading scores I had to redo the whole process again. The results showed that only an insignificant amount changed. While this insignificant change affected many values it did not change the overall look of the data. The school remained the same ranking as a top school.
